# FigJam Feedback Procedure

When handling design feedback or layout changes for this project:

1. **Fetch FigJam content** — Use the Figma MCP `get_figjam` tool with file key `ez9aFR7uZIYi7WIuL1hKA2` (node `0:1` or relevant section) to read the latest feedback. Handwritten notes are readable via the rendered images.

2. **Parse instructions** — Extract instructions from handwritten and typed content. Transcribe and correct spelling in handwritten text before implementing.

3. **Implement** — Cross-reference screenshots and design images with instructions, then apply HTML/CSS changes to match the design.

4. **Push changes to the site** — Run `npm run deploy` (optionally with a custom message). This commits, pushes, and triggers GitHub Pages deployment. See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md).

5. **Return results** — Summarize changes; when requested, provide the corrected transcription of the instructions.
