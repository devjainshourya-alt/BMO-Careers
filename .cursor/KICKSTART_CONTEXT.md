**Context restoration:** I'm resuming the BMO Career x AI project after migrating from another Windows user profile. Key context:

- **Project:** BMO Career Site — HTML/CSS site deployed via GitHub Pages
- **Design workflow:** FigJam feedback board (file key `ez9aFR7uZIYi7WIuL1hKA2`) — the AI fetches feedback via `get_figjam`, parses handwritten/typed notes, implements changes, then runs `npm run deploy`
- **Project rules:** See `.cursor/rules/figjam-feedback.mdc` and `FIGJAM_FEEDBACK_PROCEDURE.md` for the standard procedure
- **MCPs:** Figma (FigJam, design context), Pencil (.pen files), cursor-ide-browser
- **Deploy:** `npm run deploy` — commits, pushes, triggers GitHub Pages

I've followed `MIGRATION_CHECKPOINT.md` for the migration. Please use the existing project structure and rules to continue development.
