### **You**

Hey I need you help with something. So, I'm switching back to a different user on my PC due to some issues on this user profile. I want to keep working on this project with you as we have done so far. I want to kind of restore this session but on the new user profile on the PC. Is there a way to carry forward all of the context, chats, history, progress or whatsoever is required for you to continue the development or the operations on this project and create this as a sort of a checkpoint to kickstart the project where we left off , without leaving anything behind?
